# Caesar Cipher in Go

This is a simple Go program that implements a Caesar cipher (letter rotation encryption). It allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift key.

## Features

- Encrypts a plain text string by shifting letters in the alphabet.
- Decrypts the encrypted string back to the original text.
- Demonstrates string manipulation using Go's standard library.

## How It Works

- The `encrypt` function shifts each letter in the input text based on a generated cipher alphabet.
- The `decrypt` function reverses the process using the same shift key.
- Only uppercase English letters (Aâ€“Z) are handled.

## Example

```bash
Plain Text: HELLOWORLD
Encrypted : WORLDHELLO
Decrypted : HELLOWORLD
Getting Started
Prerequisites

Code Overview
hashLetterFn: Generates a shifted alphabet used for encryption/decryption.

encrypt: Converts plain text to cipher text.

decrypt: Reverses the encryption process.

main: Example usage with hardcoded inputs.

Customization
You can change the plainText and key in the main() function to try different inputs and shifts.
